## Core Features:

- Header Bar: Displays a header bar with options for authentication, such as login and sign-out.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to establish trust and security.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), a very low saturation of the primary hue to keep it soft.
- Accent color: Vivid violet (#7C4DFF), an analogous color to deep indigo, for interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text, delivering a modern and neutral reading experience.
- Header: Fixed at the top with a contrasting background, ensuring persistent visibility. Incorporate subtle animations during state changes such as transitions.
- Icons: Use simple, outlined icons for actions (e.g., user profile) that complement the sans-serif typography.
- Micro-interactions: Apply micro-interactions on button hover states to enhance user engagement.
